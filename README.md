# Improvement Roll
Randomly selected todo list

## What??
Inspired from "rolling" threads on 4chan. You can create category of tasks that you want to do (in no particular order). 
Then press the button and it will randomly give you a task to do from said list.

You can also sort tasks in a category by how long it would take to complete them and randomly select based on time.

There is already a pre-generated category available called **General**

### Simple Example:
Say you want to get in shape but are too lazy to commit to a program.
You can create a Category called **Fitness**. 
And in the **Fitness** category you can add tasks like: 
- Do 50 pushups
- Squat for 5 minutes
- Do 40 Jumping Jacks 
- *etc*

Then whenever you have free time you can open the app and select the **Fitness** category and a random on of these tasks will be given to you. 
Now its up to you to do them but at least you didnt have to think about what to do :wink:

### Timed Example:
I bet you're thinking: 
*What if the random task ive been given takes too much time to complete! :(*

Whether you are or aren't I built this feature anyways!

Lets say you are in the same situation as the simple example.
You can create the same Category called **Fitness**
During the category creation toggle the "This category is split by time" box.
Now you can enter in tasks and select how much time it takes for you to complete them.

Once you select the **Fitness** category to roll this time you will be asked how much time you have. And you will onyl be given tasks that are within that time range (If I only have 5 minutes id rather do pushups, But if I have an hour I can go for a run)

## What are these "rolling" threads
On 4chan every post give you a corresponding ID. The ID generated from a post is what people would refer to as "rolling".

*For example:* 
You could create a thread that says the last Number of your ID will determine how many pushups you do in that instance. People would then post as a reply to that thread to find out how many pushups they would do.
